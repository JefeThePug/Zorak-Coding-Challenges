Captain Xarlos awaits your calculation of the maximum number of crew members that can flow through the hallways simultaneously so he can efficiently instruct his sizable crew. </p> <h4> For example: </h4> <p> With your source at <span class=\"code part\">A</span>, your sink at <span class=\"code part\">F</span>, and a floor plan like <span class=\"code free\"> A-B 3<br> A-C 3<br> B-C 2<br> B-D 3<br> C-E 2<br> D-E 4<br> D-F 2<br> E-F 3 </span> Your task is to find the paths that result in <span class=\"b i\">getting the most possible crew members to the sink, given the hallways' capacity restrictions</span>. </p> <div class=\"imgcontainer\"> <img class=\"fill\" src=\"../static/images/10/example.gif\"> </div> <p> Demonstrated in the animation above, you can see the best paths to achieve the maximum possible flow from the source to the sink. </p> <p> In discovering this most efficient selection of paths, you can determine that the maximum flow for this floor plan is <span class=\"code part\">5</span>. </p>  =================================================================================================================================  <p> The crew is in place and ready to commence. In the distance, you can see Zorak, protected inside his Battle Dome. </p> <div class=\"imgcontainer\"> <img class=\"midpic\" src=\"../static/images/10/orb.png\"> </div> <p> According to the blueprint, this dome is a <span class=\"b i\">lattice of interconnecting points, each with specific pathways for energy flow</span>. There is only <span class=\"b i\">one viable point of attack—Point 0</span>. </p> <div class=\"imgcontainer\"> <a href=\"../static/images/10/blueprint.png\"> <img class=\"fill\" src=\"../static/images/10/blueprint.png\"> </a> </div> <p> Any laster blast targeting elsewhere on the shield will be deflected. However, when struck at Point 0, <span class=\"b i\">the dome is designed to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissipation\">dissipate</a> the energy across all its connective edges</span>. Each interconnecting point has a direction and a capacity for the amount of energy it can transmit. </p> <p> To successfully penetrate the Battle Dome, you must <span class=\"b i\">deliver a precise blast of energy from the laser</span>. Sending <span class=\"b i\">too little energy will dissipate</span> across the edges and weaken the blast, while sending <span class=\"b i\">too much will cause a short-circuit</span> if the capacity of any edge is exceeded with no alternative paths available to handle the overflow. Your task is to calculate the <span class=\"b i\">maximum flow from the source (Point 0) to the 5 sinks (Points 76, 77, 78, 79, and 80)</span>. </p> <p class=\"hint-label ssm\"> HINT (mouse-over to view):</p> <p class=\"hint ssm\"> Maximum flow algorithms work when there is only 1 sink. How would you connect these 5 sinks into one final imaginary sink to aggregate the maximum flow from all areas of the dome, and what should you consider for the capacity for these imaginary edges? </p> <p> The tiny defector has also provided you with a <span class=\"b i\">list of capacities for each edge, your puzzle input</span>, formatted similarly to your previous floor plan annotations. Connecting points are separated by hyphens, followed by a space and the capacity for that edge. <span class=\"b i\">A listed capacity of \"Inf\" indicates infinite capacity, meaning there is no limitation on the energy that can flow between those two points</span>. </p> \n"
