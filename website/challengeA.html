            <h2>Part One: <br>Morse De-Code</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            Welcome to your first day aboard the STS Space Ghost, where 
            you'll be venturing into the vastness of space for the very 
            first time. After settling into your cabin, your next stop is 
            to meet with the Officer on Deck who will provide you with 
            your inaugural job assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
            To your surprise, you find yourself entrusted with the 
            important task of <span class="b i">communications decoding</span>, 
            despite your limited experience in the field. Fortunately, 
            a stroke of luck comes your way when you recall that <span class="b i">
            a significant portion of space communications is conducted using 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code">Morse Code</a></span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although you've heard of Morse Code in passing, your 
            understanding of it is a bit hazy. With a sense of urgency, you 
            frantically search through your desk drawer, and lo and behold! 
            Serendipity leads you to a weathered booklet with yellowed pages 
            with the title "<span class="b i">Deciphering&nbsp;Morse&nbsp;Code</span>".
            Inside, you discover a comprehensive <span class="b i">table</span> 
            containing Letter to Morse Code translations, along with a 
            detailed guide on how your machine interprets the input code:
        </p>
        <div class="flex-container shadow">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Letters in the words will be seperated by 
                    <span class="b i">spaces</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Words will be seperated by <span class="b i">
                    new lines</span> (\n)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dashes will be represented by <span class="b i">

                <li>
                    Dots and dashes for each letter or character will 
                    <span class="b i">not</span> have spaces between them

            You decide that you should quickly make a Python script which

        <p>Just as you translate the question recieved, another source has sent a reply.
            Perhaps this is the answer to the question previously asked? But the contents of the
            incoming message cause your script to error. This is not Morse Code. This looks instead
            like <span class="b i">something alien</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rather than panic and run to your supervisor, you set your mind toward solving this
            problem on your own. This clearly cannot be the first time your machine has intercepted
            alien communication. You re-read your Morse Code booklet to no avail and open up your
            desk drawer to see if there is anything else that might be of use... Nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sighing heavily and putting your head in your hands, you catch a glimpse of a poster
            on the wall beside your monitor. It is titled "<span class="b i">U.B.M.T. 
            for&nbsp;Alien&nbsp;Communication</span>". Has this been here the whole time? 
            You continue reading...
        </p>
        <p>
            The poster outlines that before converting from Morse Code to text, alien communication
            must first be translated into Unicode, and then Binary.
        </p>
        <div class="shadow">
            <ol>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Converting each character to Unicode, you get<br>
                <span class="code part sm">
                    ʄ=644 ɾ=638 Ä=196 Ψ=936 R=82 E=69 m=109 ϣ=995

                and converting that number to Binary, you get<br>
                <span class="code part sm">

            </li>
            <li>
                Converting the Binary into Morse Code by considering 
                the 0s dots and the 1s dashes, you get<br>
                <span class="code part sm">

            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Unlike before, there are no spaces between letters, or new lines between words.
            Could this day get any more difficult? Wait... What's this? You notice a small asterisk
            drawn next to this step in pen on the poster and a footnote handwritten at the bottom.
        </p>
        <p class="shadow pad">
            <span class="b i">"Alien communication is always only one word."</span> Well that certainly makes this 
            easier... But what about the spaces? You continue reading. "Each recieved alien transmission<span class="b i">
            begins with three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark">Exclamation Marks</a> 
            at the start and end of the message with an additional exclamation mark between each letter</span>."
        </p>
        <p>
            Taking this into consideration, your Morse Code actually looks like this:
        <span class="code part">.... .._ __ ._ _.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Taking your original code
            <span class="code part sm">
                _._.___._.___._.__...._._.__..__._.____<br class="mbl">_._.__.__._.___._._.___._.___._.__
            </span>
            <br>And separating with the Morse Code for exclamation marks<br>
            <span class="code part sm">
                 &nbsp;(!)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(!)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(!)&nbsp;&nbsp;....&nbsp;(!)&nbsp;&nbsp;.._&nbsp;(!)&nbsp;&nbsp;__
                 <br class="mbl">&nbsp;(!)&nbsp;&nbsp;._&nbsp;(!)&nbsp;&nbsp;_.&nbsp;(!)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(!)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(!)&nbsp;
            </span>
            <br>To get the result
            <span class="code part sm">.... .._ __ ._ _.</span></p>
        <p>
            Translating <span class="code part">.... .._ __ ._ _.</span> into text with your standard Morse
            Code decoding script<br>gives you "<span class="b i">HUMAN</span>".
        </p>
        <p>
            So <span class="code part">ʄɾÄΨREmϣ</span> translates to <span class="code part">HUMAN</span>
            <br>Ok. You think you've got the hang of this! Time to decode the alien message...
