            Logging into your Discord account will save your progress with completed challenges on this site. 
                Additionally, this app gives you access to private discussion channels for each challenge 
                within the Practical Python server.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are not a member of the Practical Python server, this app will join that server for you. This 
                provides a forum for discussing your solutions and viewing the solutions of other challengers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because of this, the login prompt will require you to allow this app to control joining servers 
                automatically for you. Practical Python does not store any of your data in its database apart 
                from your username and your progress with these challenges. We promise that your personal 
                information is never kept on file.
