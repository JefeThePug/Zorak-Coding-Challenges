Morse Code</a></span>.</p>

problem on your own. You re-read your Morse Code booklet to no avail and open your desk
drawer to see if there might be anything else in there that could be of use… Nothing.</p>

<p>Sighing heavily and putting your head in your hands, you catch a glimpse of a poster
on the wall beside your monitor, which you hadn't noticed before. It's titled with the
mnemonic device, <span class="b i">"O.B.M.T. for Alien Communication"</span>, and it
reads:</p>

  Convert each character to its <span class="b i">Ordinal</span>
  <span class="sm">(Unicode code points)</span>

  Convert the Binary number into <span class="b i">Morse Code</span>
  <span class="sm">(considering the 0s dits and the 1s dahs)</span>
</li><li>
  Convert the Morse Code into <span class="b i">Text</span>

<p class="shadow pad"><span class="b i">※ Alien communication is always only one

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark">Exclamation Marks</a> at both
the start and end of the message</span>, with <span class="b i"> one Exclamation Mark
between each letter</span>.</p>

<h4>Here's an example of the alien input</h4>

<span class="code">※ƉΰـᒠW౻</span>
<ol><li>
  Converting each character it's Ordinal, you get<br/>
  <span class="code part sm" style="direction:ltr; unicode-bidi:bidi-override;">
  ※=8251 Ɖ=393 ΰ=944 ـ=1600 ᒠ=5280 W=87 ౻=3195</span>
</li><li>
  Concatenating those numbers to one large integer<br/>
  <span class="code part sm">825139394416005280873195</span><br/>
  and converting that number to Binary, you get<br/>
  <span class="code part sm">1010111010111010111001010110110101110101
   <br class="mbl"/>0111101010110101011010101011101011101011</span>
</li><li>
  Converting the Binary into Morse Code, you would get<br/>
  <span class="code part sm" style="font-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;">
   _._.___._.___._.___.._._.__.__._.___._._.__<br class="mbl"/>
   __._._.__._._.__._._._.___._.___._.__</span><br/>
  Removing the exclamation marks on both ends and between each letter, you get<br/>
  <span class="code part sm" style="font-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;">
  (!)\xa0\xa0\xa0(!)\xa0\xa0\xa0(!)\xa0\xa0_..\xa0(!)\xa0\xa0._\xa0(!)\xa0\xa0_.\xa0(!)
   <br class="mbl"/>
   __.\xa0(!)\xa0\xa0.\xa0(!)\xa0\xa0._.\xa0(!)\xa0\xa0\xa0(!)\xa0\xa0\xa0(!)</span>
  <br/>or
  <span class="code part sm" style="font-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;">
   _.. ._ _. __. . ._.</span>
</li><li>
  Converting this Morse Code into text gives you:<br/>
  <span class="code part">DANGER</span>
</li></ol>

<p>So <span class="code part">※ƉΰـᒠW౻</span>translates to

section. Each category sorted in ascending order. <span class="i">Chapter number and

of this new assignment, caused by the chaos of the paper storm, has left you feeling
overwhelmed. It seems like the Electric Control Room might not be the place for you. You
should put in a <span class="b i">Change of Assignment request</span> with the Operations
Manager, but you've left your holographic tablet in your bunk. That's okay, because 
aboard the ship, all devices have the capability of communicating with the Operations 
Manager, provided there's a screen to display the reply.</p>

<p>Luckily for you, you're stood in front of the <span class="b i">
"Binary\xa0Represented\xa0All‑Inclusive\xa0Lettering\xa0LED"</span> System, or
<span class="b i">"BrailLED"</span> for short.</p>

<p>The BrailLED is a long strip of

totaling <span class="b i">six rows</span> and <span class="b i">fifty‑two columns</span>
of individual lights.</p>

<div class="imgcontainer shadow pad"><img src="../static/images/02/strip.png"/></div>

<p>Transmissions are sent to the LED lights as <span class="b i">a packet of tuples</span>.
The first item of the tuple is a binary string and the second is a column header.
<ul><li>
   The BrailLED display Columns, from left to right, are labeled with the sorted 
   uppercase letters, A‑Z,followed by the sorted lowercase letters, a‑z.
</li><li>
   For each column, the binary string fills the column from top to bottom, assigning the 
   individual lights in that column <span class="b i">ON for 1</span> or
   <span class="b i">OFF for 0</span>.

<p>Someone must have bumped the BrailLED amidst all the confusion this morning, because
the inputs are not coming in sorted. You will have to sort the inputs by their column

lit in a white light, and you see thick tubes and chutes crisscrossing the walls and
the high ceiling. Immediately in front of you, centered in the room, you see a
<span class="b i">row of 40 giant capsule-filled tubes</span> with an opening for each
at the very top and at the front of the bottom, like upside-down
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pez">PEZ dispensers</a>. Beside this dispensing
system, bolted to the floor, is a large
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_arm">robotic arm</a>.
It is nearly as tall as the ceiling and features grips for spherical objects at the
end of its long arm.</p>

<p>You're greeted by the supervisor of the Cargo Hold, who has a kind voice and an
even kinder smile. She explains what you need to do:</p>

<p class="shadow pad">The <span class="b i">spherical capsules</span> inside these
tubes are all different kinds of cargo. They are heavy metallic balls studded with
rivets and embellishments. To tell them apart, most of the capsules are
<span class="b i">painted with a large, bright red character</span> (either
alphabetical or a punctuation symbol). The ones that lack any marking are all the
same item, so it might be helpful to think of them as a space character (" ").</p>

<p>What's inside them? She has no idea. She just gets a request from somewhere and
runs the machine to fulfill it. Requests come on a piece of paper with two sections.</p>

<ol><li>
  <span class="b i">The first line:</span> a number from 0 to 39.<br/> This indicates
  which dispenser to set the machine to <span class="b i">start</span> at.
</li><li>
  <span class="b i">The next line:</span> a series of commands for the robotic arm,
  separated by commas.<br/> Each command begins with <span class="b i">an R, L, T, or
  D</span>, followed by a<span class="b i">number</span>.
</li><li>
  <span class="b i">The following lines:</span> lines of text representing the initial
  state of capsules in all dispensers.<br/> Each line shows the contents of the
  dispensers, ordered from 0 to 39. The capsule characters are listed
  <span class="b i">from the bottom</span> of each dispenser <span class="b i">to
  the top</span>, separated by commas.
</li></ol>

<div class="shadow"><ul><li>
  When the machine gets an <span class="b i">R or L command</span>, the robotic arm
  moves its position either <span class="b">R</span>ight or <span class="b">
  L</span>eft by the numberof places indicated
</li></ul></div>

<div class="shadow"><ul><li>
  When the machine gets a <span class="b i">T command</span>, the robotic arm
  <span class="b">T</span>akes a single capsule from the dispenser at its current
  position from the bottom, letting the remaining capsules in the dispenser descend
  to fill the empty space
</li><li>
  The grabbed capsule is then vacuumed into the robotic arm's <span class="b i">C-shaped
  tube</span>, where capsules are stored, always inserting itself <span class="b i">
  into the entry point</span> of the tube
</li><li>
  This process is completed as many times as indicated by the number in the command,
  <span class="b i">always one-at-a-time</span> and never multiple capsules
  simultaneously
</li></ul></div>

<div class="shadow"><ul><li>
  When the machine gets a <span class="b i">D command</span>, the robotic arm
  <span class="b">D</span>rops the specified number of capsules, one-at-a-time, into
  the top of the dispenser it's currently facing
</li><li>
  Because of the C-shaped tube, capsules are dispensed from the <span class="b i">
  opposite end</span> of the tube
</li></ul></div>

<p>You need to manually control the machine while following the instructions. Once the
order is complete, you press the "release" button and <span class="b i">one capsule
from each dispenser</span> rolls out from the bottom, in order, onto the delivery cart
to be sent out to the appropriate area of the ship.</p>

<a herf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galley_(kitchen)">galley</a>. That's perfect,
because you could use a snack…</p>

<p>You meet the ship's head chef, who is deep in thought about the menu. Just as you're
about to mention that you could really go for a cheeseburger, he begins speaking to you,
explaining what's on his mind.</p>

<p>It turns out, the <span class="b i">only food</span> that the crew actually eats
aboardthe ship is <span class="b i">Galactic
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae">Algae</a> Blooms</span>; a thought which
slightly turns your stomach, but you hide your disgust well.</p>

<p>There are <span class="b i">five species</span> of Galactic Algae Blooms:
<span class="b i">Sweet, Bitter, Umami, Salty, and Sour</span>. The depth of flavor of
each of these species varies from bloom to bloom, each having its own scores for both
<span class="b i">flavor complexity, persistence of taste, and intensity</span>. A
skilled chef can take these individual flavor profiles and create dishes that resemble
many non-algae-based dishes the crew are familiar with from home.</p>

<p>The process is as follows:</p><div class="shadow pad">
<ol><li>
  <span class="b i">Gather algae from each of the required species</span>:
</li><ul><li>
  You select three individual algae blooms (your puzzle input) and obtain each of their
  flavor profiles.
</li><li>
  Flavor complexity is labeled X, so the three algae blooms you would use of a certain
  species have x1, x2, and x3.
</li><li>
  Persistence of taste is labeled Y; y1, y2, and y3.
</li><li>
  Intensity is cleverly labeled m for "Mmm". Each algae bloom has its own individual
  intensity; m1, m2, and m3.
</li><li>
  Each line of your input represents a species of Galactic Algae Bloom.
  <span class="b i">Individual algae blooms are separated by spaces</span>. For each
  individual algae bloom, the format is
  Intensity(Flavor\xa0Complexity,Persistence\xa0of\xa0taste) or <span class="b i">
  m(x,y)</span>.
</li></ul><li>
  <span class="b i">Seek out the Center of Flavor for each species</span>:
</li><ul><li>
  To determine the Center of Flavors of a species with three individual algae blooms,
  you use the common <span class="b i">Center of Mass</span>(cm) equations.
</li></ul></ol>
  <div class="imgcontainer pad"><img src="../static/images/04/CoMx_simple.png"/></div>
  <div class="imgcontainer pad"><img src="../static/images/04/CoMy_simple.png"/></div>
<ol><ul><li>
  Finding the Center of Flavor at X and at Y will provide you with the Center of Flavor
  coordinates on the complexity-persistence graph. You will have a set of coordinates
  for each species used in the recipe.
</li></ul><li>
  <span class="b i">Lookup the values in the ASCII Recipe Cards</span>:
</li><ul><li>
  Translating the <span class="b i">numerical value</span> of each coordinate
  <span class="b i">to its ASCII</span> value will provide you with two letters per
  species of Galactic Algae Blooms. One letter for X and one letter for Y.
</li></ul><li>
  <span class="b i">Complete the recipe</span>:
</li><ul><li>
  Concatenating the letters for all the X coordinates in order, a space, and all the 
  letters for the Y coordinates in order, will spell out the recipe item.

8(75,80) 4(72,71) 18(69,77)</span></p>

<p>To get the Center of Mass at X for the first species, you would put the numbers into
the equation:<br/>for the numerator <span class="code part">(6*71) + (6*70) + (3*68) = 
1050</span><br/> and the denominator <span class="code part">6 + 6 + 3 = 15</span>
giving you <span class="code part">1050/15</span><br/><span class="code part">70</span>
for the X value.</p>

<p>To get the Center of Mass at Y for the first species, you would put the numbers into
the equation:<br/>for the numerator <span class="code part">(6*74) + (6*73) + (3*76) =
1110</span>.<br/>The denominator remains the same as for X, <span class="code part">
15</span> giving you <span class="code part">1110/15</span><br/>
<span class="code part">74</span> for the Y value.</p>

<p>Performing the same operations on all three species, we get X and Y values:
<span class="code part">(70, 74), (73, 65), and (71, 77)</span></p>

<p>Converting these numbers to ASCII values, you get: <span class="code part">(F, J),

many algae blooms as possible.</p>

<p>In your previous equations for the Center of Mass, you had only 3 points to consider,

<p>Looking at the C-shaped cluster on the right, you can calculate the

<br/> = 1722</span> Since you are looking for an integer position on the grid, you can
use integer division to get the Center of Mass' position at X. You take the numerator
you just calculated, and divide it by the total mass in the denominator.<br/>
<span class="code part">1722 // 95 = 18</span></p>

<p>You do the same for the Y positions <span class="b i">(m*x)</span> for the Center of

<p>Here's how the Power Harvester works:<br/>
After sending a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon">photon</a> collection

(Patterned Image Layout) System, which reconstructs it into a square image</span>. The
resulting image displays the number of GJ harvested.</p>

<p>Despite its age, the Power Harvester is known for its good old-fashioned reliability

  You can be certain that <span class="b i">the length of wire extruded from the Power

  To create the image, <span class="b i">start at point (0,0)</span> and lay wire

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_management_(electronics)">Thermal
Defense </a>Room. This room serves as the ship's primary defense against the
unforgiving natural perils of space — extreme heat and harmful
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation">radiation</a>.</p>

<p>In space, the ship is constantly bombarded with <span class="b i"> waves of different
frequencies and wavelengths</span>. Some of these waves, called <span class="b i">
Solar Waves, are damaging</span> to the structure of the ship, while others, called
<span class="b i">Cosmic Waves, are harmless</span>.</p>

<p>The ship has a Thermal Defense System in place, but it works best when
it is specifically targeted at harmful Solar Waves.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">comma-separated</a>
database is already on file, containing the individual frequencies and wavelengths of
previously intercepted waves. However, <span class="b i">some incoming waves have a
combination of frequency and wavelength that has not yet been classified</span>.</p>

<p>Your job is to <span class="b i">determine if these waves are harmful</span> Solar
Waves or harmless Cosmic Waves. To do so, you need to find <span class="b i">the 7
known waves</span> from the database <span  class="b i">that are nearest to the unknown
wave</span>.</p>

<p>The distance between waves is determined by graphing the coordinates, with
<span class="b i">frequency representing the x-axis</span> and <span class="b i">
wavelength representing the y-axis</span>.</p>

<div class="imgcontainer"><img class="pad" src="../static/images/06/euclidian1.png"/>
</div>The <span class="b i">
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance">Euclidean Distance Formula
</a></span>(above) is then used to gauge how near or far one point is from another. The
<span class="b i">majority type among the 7 closest neighbors</span> of a new wave will
determine whether that new wave is a Solar Wave or a Cosmic Wave.

<p>The data provided, your puzzle input, begins with a <span class="b i">single line of
new waves</span>, with each wave represented by its frequency and wavelength separated
by a comma; the <span class="b i">individual waves are separated by spaces</span>.
Following this line are <span class="b i"> several lines in a comma-separated 
format</span>, providing a <span class="b i">database of known waves</span>. In this
format, the first column is "frequency", the second column is "wavelength", and the
third column is "type". Determine whether each new wave is a Solar Wave
(<span class="b i">S</span>) or a Cosmic Wave (<span class="b i">C</span>), and 
concatenate these results without spaces into an <span class="b i"> uppercase 
five-character output</span>.</p>

<h4>For example:</h4>

<p>Your unknown waves are <span class="code part">(9,2) (6,4) (3,5)</span><br/> and
your database consists of<span class="code free">
  frequency,wavelength,type<br/>
  10,7,Cosmic<br/>
  9,1,Solar<br/>
  7,2,Solar<br/>
  8,3,Cosmic<br/>
  10,2,Solar<br/>
  9,3,Solar<br/>
  1,5,Cosmic<br/>
  4,5,Cosmic<br/>
  9,4,Solar<br/>
  3,3,Solar</span></p>

<p>
To find the distance from the first unknown wave (9,2) to the first wave in the database
(10,7), you would apply the Euclidean Distance Formula, taking the sum of the difference
of the Xs squared and the difference of the Ys squared:<br/><span class="code part">
√( (10-9)² + (7-2)² )  =  √( 1² + 5² )  =  √( 1 + 25 )  =<br/>√( 26 )  =  5.099</span></p>

<p>So the distance between the first unknown target wave and the known Cosmic Wave at
(10,7) is <span class="code part">5.099</span></p>

<p>Applying this formula to every wave in the database you get:<span class="code free">
frequency,wavelength,type,<span class="b">distance</span><br/>
10,7,Cosmic,<span class="b">5.099</span><br/>
9,1,Solar,<span class="b">1.000</span><br/>
7,2,Solar,<span class="b">2.000</span><br/>
8,3,Cosmic,<span class="b">1.414</span><br/>
10,2,Solar,<span class="b">1.000</span><br/>
9,3,Solar,<span class="b">1.000</span><br/>
1,5,Cosmic,<span class="b">8.544</span><br/>
4,5,Cosmic,<span class="b">5.830</span><br/>
9,4,Solar,<span class="b">2.000</span><br/>
3,3,Solar,<span class="b">6.082</span></span>

Since you have such a small amount of data in this example, let's only look at the
<span class="b i">3 nearest neighbors</span>. Those would be
<ol><li>
  Solar Wave at (9,1)
</li><li>
  Solar Wave at (10,2)
</li><li>
  Solar Wave at (9,3)
</li></ol>

Majority wins (and in this case all neighbors are the same type) so the unknown wave at 
(9,2) is Solar, or <span class="code part">S</span>.</p>

<p>Repeating the same process for all the unknown waves, you get
<ol><li>
  for (9,2): Solar, Solar, Solar = <span class="b i">S</span>
</li><li>
  for (6,4): Cosmic, Cosmic, Solar = <span class="b i">C</span>
</li><li>
  for (3,5): Cosmic, Cosmic, Solar = <span class="b i">C</span>
</li></ol>
  So our uppercase output would be<span class="code part">SCC</span></p>""",

<span class="b i">direct the Thermal Defense System at them</span>, but the diagnostic
panel indicates a <span class="b i">critical malfunction</span>. This malfunction has
prevented the system from repairing itself or identifying the broken part.</p>

<p>The entire Thermal Defense System comprises <span class="b i">multiple types of
<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bespoke">bespoke</a> parts</span>,
each designed for different levels of radiation protection and thermal management.
Because many different parts share similar qualities, it is difficult to determine
the exact replacement needed.</p>

<p>In the parts storage, you <span class="b i">find a replacement part</span> that
matches some of the specifications of the broken component. However, the specifications
alone — <span class="b i">mass, density, thickness, area, and radiation output</span>
 — are insufficient to confirm the exact component required. This is because various
parts have similar physical characteristics but different performance metrics and
configurations.</p>

<p>To identify the unknown part, you'll need to <span class="b i">compare it to all
parts in the database</span> by measuring similarity across multiple dimensions. You
can gauge this similarity <span class="b i">using Euclidean distance</span> — the
smaller the distance, the more similar the parts. However, since there are
<span class="b i">more than two dimensions</span> to each part, you need to use a more
robust equation with <span class="code part">q</span> representing the target's value and
<span class="code part">p</span> representing the value from the database you are
comparing it to. with Σ representing the aggregate squared differences of each dimension
from 1 to n.</p>

<div class="imgcontainer">
<img class="midpic" src="../static/images/06/euclidian2.png"/></div>

<p>Just as you did when sorting the waves, you need to look at <span class="b i">the 7
Thermal Defense System parts nearest to the mystery part</span>. Then you can determine
its purpose based on the majority of its <span class="b i">nearest neighbors</span>.</p>

<p>Your data consists of a first line, the specifications of the mystery part, separated
by commas, followed by the database of known parts, similarly comma-separated, with
columns for mass, density, thickness, area, radiation output, and type.</p>

<h4>For example:</h4>

<p>If your mystery part, the target (<span class="b i">q</span>), has the values
<span class="code free">mass,density,thickness,area,radiation_output<br/>
12.5,31.22,3.402,2.0,0.053</span> and you want to find its distance compared to this
"<span class="b i">Boron\xa0Nitride\xa0Nanotube\xa0Composite</span>" part in the 
database (<span class="b i">p</span>)<span class="code free">
mass,density,thickness,area,radiation_output<br/>15.9,10.6,4.47,2.79,0.451</span></p>

<p>Following the Euclidean distance formula above, you need the square root of the sum 
of all the following differences squared.
<ol><li>mass</li><ul><li><span class="code part">(12.5 - 15.9)² = 11.56</span></li></ul>
<li>density</li><ul><li><span class="code part">(31.22 - 10.6)² = 425.1844</span></li></ul>
<li>thickness</li><ul><li><span class="code part">(3.402 - 4.47)² = 1.1406</span></li></ul>
<li>area</li><ul><li><span class="code part">(2.0 - 2.79)² = 0.6241</span></li></ul>
<li>radiation output</li><ul><li><span class="code part">(0.053 - 0.451)² = 0.1584</span>
</li></ul></ol></p>

<p>You take the square root of the sum of these differences <span class="code part">
√( 11.56 + 425.1844 + 1.1406 + 0.6241 + 0.1584 ) =<br/>√( 438.6675 )  =  20.9443</span></p>

<p>The distance between the mystery part in the example and the one
Boron\xa0Nitride\xa0Nanotube\xa0Composite part is <span class="code part">

<span class="b i">Propaganda Inspecting LumiCam (PIL)</span> app built into your
holographic tablet, designed to <span class="b i">scan images for color</span>.</p>

<p>To uncover the <span class="b i">hidden message</span>, you need to program it to
act as a
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter">
Counter</a> for each pixel color you scan. You decide on a quick course of action.</p>

<div class="shadow pad"><ol><li>Scan the Image</li><ul><li>
  Use your PIL app to scan the strange colors from the eyes of the image (your puzzle
  input)
</li></ul><li>Count the Colors</li><ul><li>
  The app should count each color pixel and provide you with a list of RGB tuples for
  the top three most frequent colors in descending order 
</li></ul><li>Convert Hex Values</li><ul><li>
  Convert the RGB tuples to <a href="https://www.color-hex.com/">hex color values</a>
  and then change all of the digits to their closest uppercase letter using the 
  following mapping:<br/>
  <span class="b i">0=O, 1=I, 2=Z, 3=E, 4=A, 5=S, 6=G, 7=T, 8=B, and 9=P</span>
</li></ul></ol></div>

<p>The resulting <span class="b i">six-letter words from the top three hex color values
</span> will reveal the secret message hidden inside the propaganda paper.</p>

<h4>For example:</h4>
<p>Using this image below,</p>
<div class="imgcontainer"><img class="midpic" src="../static/images/07/sample.png"/></div>

<p>We get the following counts for pixel colors: <span class="code free">

cup of coffee is the coffee machine in the Crew Quarters' common room. No one's around
so you put the propaganda paper down on the table and start to make a cup of coffee for
yourself.</p>

<p>Suddenly, you hear a small high-pitched voice behind you. Out of the corner of your
eye, you see what looks like a small Aurawrought being, about 20cm tall.</p>

<div class="imgcontainer">
<img class="smallpic" src="../static/images/08/defector.png"/></div>

<p>You whip around, keeping an eye out for some sort of weapon you can use, all while
trying not to break eye contact with the creature. Sensing your distress, it quickly
tells you that it has come in peace, explaining further that it is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defection">defector</a> from the Aurawrought
army. It left the propaganda on the ship in hopes someone would find it and get in
touch, because it has important information to share.</p>

<p>The Aurawrought have long devoted themselves to Eos, goddess of the dawn, and have
lamented her imprisonment in the galactic vortex where she has been held for centuries.
Recently, however, the scientists among the Aurawrought have come up with a means to
free her. This defector insists that it does not share the zealotry of its fellow
Aurawroughts and seeks your help to stop its brethren from unleashing a dangerous deity
into the universe. You are skeptical, but something in its demeanor convinces you to
trust it. The tiny defector says it needs to prepare some documents for you —
<span class="b i">a map</span> to travel directly to the Aurawroughts, avoiding their
army's entire fleet, and <span class="b i">the blueprints of the technology</span> they
are planning to use to free Eos. It promises to be in touch soon and asks you to wait
for it to return with the paperwork.</p><hr/>

<p>In the meantime, you look around at the state of the common area. A new shipment of
coffee beans had arrived just in time, as there was nothing left from the old shipment
besides the handful of beans inside the machine. All the bags of coffee beans are inside
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem">knapsack</a>, waiting to be
shelved. To kill time, you decide to take some initiative and <span class="b i">
stock some coffee</span>.</p>

<p>There are <span class="b i">100 bags of coffee beans in varying sizes</span> from all
over Earth, and they will not all fit on the shelf. You scan the inventory list on your
holographic tablet, which displays a comma-separated document detailing the shipment:
<span class="b i">country, bean type, roast, width of the bag, and popularity rating
</span> — your puzzle input. You should:</p>

<ol><li><span class="b i">Consider an Individual Coffee Bag:</span>
</li><ul>
  Define a way to group together the country, bean type, roast, width, and
  popularity rating for each coffee bag.
</ul><li><span class="b i">Create a Plan to Organize the Shelf:</span>
</li><ul>
  Consider a shelf an object that can <span class="b i"> hold a certain number of coffee
  bags</span>, remembering it has a fixed width capacity.
</ul><li><span class="b i">Stock the Shelf Efficiently:</span>
</li><ul>
  Implement a method to store the coffee bags on the shelf with <span class="b i"> the
  best possible popularity rating while minimizing wasted space</span>.
</ul></ol>

<p>By organizing the coffee bags this way, you can ensure that the shelf is stocked with
the best selection for the crew.</p>

<h4>For example, look at a small shelf of<span class="code part">70</span>cm:</h4>

<p>If you have the following inventory<span class="code free">

Jamaica,Arabica,Light Roast,40,5<br/>

Columbia,Typica,French Roast,30,4<br/>
Uganda,Arabica,Vienna Roast,10,2<br/>
Mexico,MundoNovo,Cinnamon Roast,30,2</span>
To minimize wasted space you should fill the shelf with coffee bags totaling as close
to 70cm as possible.</p>

<p>Several combinations are possible: Choosing the coffees from <span class="b i">
Jamaica and Columbia</span> total 70cm, as does combining <span class="b i">Jamaica and
Mexico</span>. Smaller bags can also reach 70m, such as those from <span class="b i">
Columbia, Uganda, and Mexico</span>. It is also possible to obtain a high popularity
rating while coming up slightly short of 70cm, like with <span class="b i">Brazil,
Columbia, and Uganda</span>, which total 60cm. With so many options, the goal is to
<span class="b i">select the combination that yields the highest total popularity
rating</span>.</p>

maximum flow</a></span> — the greatest number of crew members that can move through the
hallways at one time.</p>

<p>You quickly annotate <span class="b i">the floor plan</span> on your holographic
tablet, <span class="b i">listing each hallway as a pair of connected rooms separated by
a hyphen, followed by a space and the hallway's capacity</span> — this serves as your
puzzle input.</p>

<p>It's crucial that no crew members linger in any room or hallway, as this would
restrict the flow. The entire crew that <span class="b i">starts from the source (S1)
must travel to the destination (MD) and arrive together</span>. Captain Xarlos awaits your
calculation of the maximum number of crew members that can flow through the hallways
simultaneously so he can efficiently instruct his sizable crew.</p>

<h4>For example:</h4>

<p>With your source at <span class="code part">A</span>, your destination at
<span class="code part">F</span>, and a floor plan like <span class="code free">
A-B 3<br/>
A-C 3<br/>
B-C 2<br/>
B-D 3<br/>
C-E 2<br/>
D-E 4<br/>
D-F 2<br/>
E-F 3</span>
Your task is to find the paths that result in <span class="b i">getting the most possible
crew members to the destination, given the hallways' capacity restrictions</span>.</p>

<p>Demonstrated in the animation above, you can see the best paths to achieve the
maximum possible flow from the source to the destination.</p>

<p>Identifying the most efficient path selection allows you to determine that the maximum
flow for this floor plan is <span class="code part">5</span>.</p>""",

technology that the Aurawroughts intend to use to free Eos from her galactic prison,
safeguarded within a protective dome.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the tiny defector materializes again, seemingly out of nowhere, holding a
large rolled sheet of paper. It explains that these are the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueprint"><span class="b i">blueprints</span></a>
for the protective dome</p>

<p>The inner technology is delicate and can quite easily be destroyed with a blast from a
laser, but the dome is much stronger. According to the blueprint, this dome is a
<span class="b i">lattice of interconnecting nodes, each with specific pathways for energy
flow</span>. There is only <span class="b i">one viable point of attack — Node 0</span>.</p>

<div class="imgcontainer"><a href="../static/images/10/blueprint.png">
<img class="fill" src="../static/images/10/blueprint.png"/></a></div>

<p>Any laster blast targeting elsewhere on the shield will be deflected. However, when
struck at Node 0, <span class="b i">the dome is designed to disperse the incoming energy
across all its connected edges</span>. Each interconnecting node has a direction and a
capacity for the amount of energy it can transmit.</p>

<p>To successfully penetrate the dome and destroy the technology inside, you must first
<span class="b i">deliver a precise blast of energy from the laser</span>. Sending
<span class="b i">too little energy will dissipate</span> across the edges and weaken the
blast, while sending <span class="b i">too much will cause an overload</span> if the
capacity of any edge is exceeded with no alternative paths available to handle the
overflow. Your task is to calculate the <span class="b i">maximum flow from the source
(Node 0) to all 5 destinations (Nodes 76, 77, 78, 79, and 80) combined</span>.</p>

<p class="hint-label ssm">HINT (mouse-over to view):</p>
<p class="hint ssm">Maximum flow algorithms work when there is only 1 destination. How
would you connect these 5 destinations into one final imaginary destination to aggregate 
the maximum flow from all areas of the dome, and what should you consider for the
capacity for these imaginary edges?</p>

<p>The tiny defector has also provided you with a <span class="b i">list of capacities
for each edge</span>, your puzzle input, formatted similarly to your previous floor plan
annotations. Connecting nodes are separated by hyphens, followed by a space and the
capacity for that edge. <span class="b i">A listed capacity of "Inf" indicates infinite
capacity, meaning there is no limitation on the energy that can flow between those two 
nodes</span>.</p>""",
