            Having successfully passed the comprehension exam, you are admitted into the Laser Room.
            You see a gigantic machine pointed toward the sky with a rather simple control panel of
            two large buttons. The label on the machine reads "<span class="b i">P.I.L.</span>" which 
            stands for "<span class="b i">Pulsar&nbsp;Intercepting&nbsp;Laser</span>". 
        </p>
        <p>
            On the monitor, you see a map of the pulsars within the laser's range. 
        </p>
        <div>
            <a href="starmap.png">
                <div class="imgcontainer code">
                    <img src="starmap.png">
                </div>
            <p class="main ssm attach">[ click to view full sized image ]</p>
            </a>
        </div>
        <p>
            You are briefed on the PIL by the lead technician:
        </p>
        <div class="shadow pad">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The PIL will emit a frequency of light in the direction of your provided
                    coordinates, which hits the pulsar, causing it to <span class="b i">flood 
                    out</span> in all directions until it reaches an edge. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    This reaction, if present on the <span class="b i">entire pulsar</span>, will 
                    emit 200 gigajoules (GJ) of energy, received by the PIL's sensors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Unfortunately, a single pulse of the PIL costs 100 GJ so the <span class="b i">
                    net energy gained</span> from completely filling a pulsar is 100 GJ, not 200 GJ.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a pulsar is completely filled <span class="b i">more than once</span>, the PIL's 
                    sensors are able to intercept 1100 GJ from it instead of 200 GJ. 
                    <br><span class="i sm">It does not matter if the pulsar is filled more than twice.
                    It will only either emit 200 GJ for one fill or 1100 GJ for more than one.</span>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            She continues to explain how the PIL's sensors are able to receive and store the energy 
            from the pulsars, but you start to zone out. Science has never been your strong suit. 
            What you do know, however, is that your job is to determine if the energy gained from 
            your printout of coordinates <span class="i sm">(your puzzle input)</span> is worth the 
            cost of running the PIL and, if so, how much energy is net.  
        </p>
        <p>
            You notice that the pulsars on the monitor overlap and manage to ask the lead technician
            before she leaves if the laser will flood to the edge of the pulsar you hit only, or to 
            any edge of any pulsar it encounters when they overlap. 
            <br>She lets you know that the PIL only floods until it encounters 
            <span class="b">any edge</span> including the boundaries of the map and to think of the map 
            as a <span class="b i"><a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.ndarray.html">
            2D grid</a> of pixels</span>. Each of your coordinates targets a pixel on the map.
            You can press the "scan" button as many times as you like to check your net energy, and 
            the PIL will not waste any energy. Energy is only lost when retrieving the pulsars' energy
            by pushing the "collect" button which will only be done once you deliver your results to
            the lead technician. 
        </p>
            For example, looking at a smaller map and list of coordinates:
        </p>
        <div class="shadow">
            <div class="flex-container">
                <div class="column">

                </div>
                <div class="column">

                        <span class="code">

                            329, 181,<br>
                            368, 339
                        </span>
                        Coordinates are indicated by red dots on the following map
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="flex-container">

                    <p>
                        After the PIL floods those areas
                        you see them indicated in yellow
                        on the following map
                    </p>
                </div>

            <div class="flex-container">
                <div class="column">
                    <img class="smallpic" src="testresult0b.png">
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <p>
                        There are two full pulsars colored (circled). 
                        The other yellow area does not count because
                        the pulsar is not fully flooded.
                    </p>
                </div>   
            </div>   
        </div>
        <p>
            Two full pulsars flooded only once provides 400 GJ of energy. 
            But four coordinates cost 400 GJ of energy, making the net 0 GJ.
            This process does not seem as efficient as it could be. You open
            the metal cover on the side of the laser labeled "CALIBRATIONS" 
            and inside you see an empty rectangular slot like you'd find in a
            camera. You open the desk drawer looking for something that would 
            fit inside that slot and discover a small square <span class="b i">
            mirror</span> that is the perfect length for the slot. Of course!
            You could double the output of the laser by <span class="b i">
            mirroring the x and y coordinates</span>!  
        </p>
        <p>
            This would mean, at the energy cost of your four coordinates,
            <span class="code sm">
                (66, 147) (120, 123) (329, 181) (368, 339)
            </span>
            you could fill eight coordinates worth of pulsars!
            <span class="code sm">
                (66, 147) (120, 123) (329, 181) (368, 339)<br>
                (147, 68) (123, 120) (181, 329) (339, 368)
            </span>
        </p>
        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="column">
                <img class="smallpic" src="testresult1.png">
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <p>
                    Two coordinates in each area of the upper left pulsar 
                    painted cyan to indicate it was flooded twice. A single 
                    coordinate in the bottom, left-of-the-middle pulsar 
                    painted yellow to indicate it was flooded only once.
                </p>
            </div>  
        </div>
        <p>
            The other pulsars on the right side are not completely 
            filled, either getting interrupted by the boundary, or
            missing a small area (circled in red). 
        </p> 
        <p>
            The one complete cyan pulsar provides an energy gain of 1100 GJ
            and the one complete yellow pulsar provides 200 GJ. When you 
            subtract the 400 GJ it cost to send a pulse to these eight 
            coordinates with the mirror, you get a total net energy of 900 GJ. 
        </p>

            Lucky for you, you are a wiz at Python and just so happen to know
            there is a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pillow/">PIL Library</a> 
            at your disposal. You can bang out your coordinates in no time!
        </p>
        <p class="hint-label ssm"> HINT (mouse-over to view):</p>
        <p class="hint ssm">
            PIL Library (pillow) comes with a built-in flood fill function, but 
            try to use the flood fill function you made for Part One instead.
            numpy.array() can easily take a PIL.Image object and turn it into
            an array of RGB values representing each pixel. You can also use
            the PIL.Image.fromarray() method to take a numpy array turn it back
            into an image to view your results.
